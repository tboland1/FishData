# FishData
Automation Software for Fish Facility Data Collection


## The Idea: Brainstorming
A basic program with the features we need that grabs information about a facility from a excel file. That way even without a developer to help a new facility can be set up by simply providing an excel sheet anyone can understand
Like facility name
Number of units
Size of units

This way people working on the fish farm can make changes on the fly because ultimately it's just changing a number or adding a unit in Excel.

And then writing all information into simultaneously a format for the program but also all data getting sent into Excel so anyone from any department can read the excel file but the alternative format exists in case anyone fucks up the excel file

And then for each financial year you just have a new basic excel file that contains which period this one runs for

I'm thinking all we need is a glorified excel sheet that keeps track of incredibly simple data and information

I don't want a program that needs to be set up with each facility. I want the facilities to be set up in easily used programs like excel. For example with some cells locked and unchanging so people can't fuck it up

Most importantly just something that doesn't break

Like I don't want any internet connection for the program
Just save it on our server which a computer has access to
I'd need to think more about it but I think it's possible to clearly define what it needs to do
UI/UX almost doesn't matter
Again, glorified excel sheet
